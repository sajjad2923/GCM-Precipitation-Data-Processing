# GCM-Precipitation-Data-Processing
A project for processing CMIP6/CMIP5 precipitation data for both historical runs and SSP scenarios. The project extracts time series of precipitation data for specific coordinates, converts units to mm/day, and calculates average precipitation. Results are saved in Excel and text formats.
